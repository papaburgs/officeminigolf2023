# Office Mini golf ball dispenser
For the hole design we want to try to have an automated system to deploy balls.
Plan to have a keycode system, where if a good pin is entered, the ball gets released somewhere
which makes the hole easy to complete. If a bad pin is entered, or no pin, 
the ball gets dropped somewhere which makes the hole harder to complete.

## Logical layout

## Components
1. Ball storage and release mechanism
    * store balls and release one when instructed (ie, push the '#' button on the keypad)
    * was going to try a plunger/electromagnet method, but think a servo/stepper motor method is more consistent
    * the Arduino will watch for a signal from the
