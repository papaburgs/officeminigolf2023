# Unknown keypad
I have an old keypad from 30 years ago, never knew how it worked, but think I have an idea now.


based on resistance tests, think this is how the pins are aligned.

Still not sure about pin 1, it might be a GND

- pin 2 - row 1
- pin 3 - row 2
- pin 4 - row 3
- pin 5 - row 4
- pin 6 - col 1
- pin 7 - col 2
- pin 8 - col 3
